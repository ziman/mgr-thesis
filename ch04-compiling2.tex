\chapter{Verified and total exception compiler}
\label{chap:compiling2}

\section{Adding exceptions, take two}

\todo{Take the handlers-at-UNMARK approach and describe it from scratch, not
wasting much time on details (they have already been said). The idea is that
for somebody familiar with the topic, it should be sufficient to read this
chapter (Chapter 3 is more didactical, gradually improving on a na\"{i}ve
solution).}

\section{Linearization}

\todo{Linearize the handler code}

\section{Execution}

\todo{Introduce the third machine state and describe execution.}

\section{Correctness}

\todo{Prove correctness}
\todo{Mention jumps and labels done in GMH -- handler code attached to MARK via label but occurs at unmark}
\todo{infixr fixities: 5 or 50?}
